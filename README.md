## Introduction

The Simon Game project recreates the classic memory game, combining HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for logic and interactivity. The game challenges players to memorize and replicate sequences of colors, which become increasingly complex as the game progresses. The game starts when the player presses any key on the keyboard.

## Technologies Used

- *HTML* - Provides the structure of the game board and buttons.
- *CSS* - Adds styling to the game, making it visually appealing.
- *JavaScript* - Implements the game logic, handles user input, and tracks the sequences.
  
## Usage

  The game is initiated by pressing any key on the keyboard. A color sequence is displayed, and the player must replicate the sequence by clicking on the color buttons in the correct order. The sequence becomes 
  longer with each round, increasing the difficulty level.

## Project Structure

The project has a basic structure:
